# Highlights

* Provide a platform for **recieving the notification of test result**
* Utlizing the block chain and IPMS to **prevent falsify of vaccination record and test result** 


# Inspiration

During the COVID-19 pandemic, people are required to acquire a negative COVID-19 test result before travelling aboard in order to decline the spreading of the disease. As the test result takes time and expeniture, some people are trying to falsify the result. Varies false certificates and fake documents were sold within the airport and onine platform, like telegram. <br/>

When we trying to solve this problem, a similar case about falsify of document pop up in our discussion. It is about Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) making a **digital certificate** for graduate student by the technology of blockchain. Whereas blockchain is a technology which stores digital asset in a decentralized way, in the other word, the data is stored in an commonly owned open space which is less easy to be maliciously modified. <br/>

Therefore, we think of using the **blockchain** associated with **InterPlanetary File System (IPFS)** to make a immunity passport. And we proudly named it as **Halo passport**.


# What it does

Halo is an app helping users to **tidy up all the vaccination and test record**, also being **an immunity passport** when boarding.

Considering some travellers having a busy schedule, a **Time Line function** is designed and shows all the details of the vaccinations and tests did or going to be carry out. It aims to help users to manage and keep up-to-date with all the stuffs related to the COVID vaccinations and tests. For example, users can be acknowledge when will be the time realeasing the test result and hence read the result at the app.

After collecting the result, Halo passport can then be used as **an immunity passport**. A quick reponse (QR) code will be generated at the app directing to the record of the vaccinations and tests stored in IPFS and blockchain. The customs officers can scan the QR code to check personal information of the users and status of them. As the record of vaccinations and tests are directly sent from  the clinic, hospital and laboratory. It is merely possible to falsify the result.



# How we built it
(...)


# Accomplishment we proud of

We, togather made a functional and good looking apps at a limited time, which is sooo cool.


# What is next for Halo?
